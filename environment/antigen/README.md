# Antigen
A plugin manager used for managing zsh plugins.

Antigen makes it easy to install plugins.

Go to **[link](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen/wiki/Installation)** to install antigen.

I recommend installing with OS package manager.

apt or apt-get for debian based OS, Homebrew if you're using MacOS

After installing antigen, copy the zsh file for antigen and paste it at the beginning of **antigen.sh** file
