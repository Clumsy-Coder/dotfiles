# :warning: `Dotbot` is no longer being used. Replaced with ansible. check [README.md](../../README.md) :warning:

# meta/install-script

Scripts that are run from a config file in `dotfiles/meta/configs/` folder.

#### Why

Dotbot is capable running shell commands, but it's easier to use a bash script to execute.
